name: reflect
description: A skill for wrapping up a session — summarizing work done, updating docs, and logging learnings. Trigger on "/reflect", "reflect", "session reflect", "end session", "세션 정리", "오늘 한 거 정리", or "마무리". Use this skill at the end of any substantial work session (30+ minutes), when the user says "done", "wrap up", "what did we do", or when a significant feature or milestone is completed — even if they don't explicitly ask for reflection.

# reflect

A session wrap-up skill that runs 4 analysis agents in parallel, then validates with a duplicate-checker, and lets you choose which actions to take.

## Step 1: Check Current Project State

Before launching any agents, gather context inline:

- List files in the current working directory
- Note any files created or modified in this session (check conversation history)
- Produce a concise `PROJECT_STATE` string summarizing the session activity

This `PROJECT_STATE` will be passed as context to each Phase 1 agent.

---

## Step 2: Phase 1 — Parallel Analysis

Launch all 4 agents in a single response — running them sequentially would take 4x longer, and since the agents don't depend on each other's results, parallel execution is both faster and produces better analysis because each agent works from the same unbiased project state.

Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for each:

### Task 1 — doc-updater

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
prompt: |
  You are a documentation specialist performing a focused analysis.

  PROJECT STATE:
  {PROJECT_STATE}

  Your job: Review existing documentation files (README.md, any .md files
  in the project) and identify what needs updating based on the session's work.

  Steps:
  1. Use Glob to find all .md files in the project
  2. Read the most relevant ones (README.md first, then other docs)
     - If CLAUDE.md is present, read it for context only — do NOT suggest updates to it.
       CLAUDE.md is an agent instruction file, not a documentation target.
  3. Compare their content against the PROJECT STATE

  Return ONLY a structured list:
  ## doc-updater results
  - File: [filename] | Section: [section] | Update: [what to add/change]
  (If nothing needs updating, say "No doc updates needed.")
```

### Task 2 — automation-scout

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
prompt: |
  You are an automation specialist performing a focused analysis.

  PROJECT STATE:
  {PROJECT_STATE}

  Your job: Identify repeating patterns in this session's work that could be automated
  as a skill, script, or CLAUDE.md hook.

  Steps:
  1. Review the PROJECT STATE for repeated actions or manual steps
  2. Check .claude/skills/ AND ~/.claude/skills/ to avoid suggesting skills that already exist
  3. Propose specific automations

  Return ONLY a structured list:
  ## automation-scout results
  - Pattern: [what was repeated] | Type: [skill/script/hook] | Suggestion: [how to automate]
  (If nothing to automate, say "No automation opportunities found.")
```

### Task 3 — learning-extractor

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
prompt: |
  You are a learning specialist performing a focused analysis.

  PROJECT STATE:
  {PROJECT_STATE}

  Your job: Extract and summarize the key learnings from this session.

  Steps:
  1. Review what was built, fixed, or explored in this session
  2. Identify new concepts, tools, patterns, or techniques encountered
  3. Note connections to existing knowledge

  Return ONLY a structured list:
  ## learning-extractor results
  - Learned: [concept/tool/pattern] | Detail: [brief explanation] | Explore more: [yes/no]
  (If nothing new was learned, say "No new learnings identified.")
```

### Task 4 — followup-suggester

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
prompt: |
  You are a task planning specialist performing a focused analysis.

  PROJECT STATE:
  {PROJECT_STATE}

  Your job: Identify what should be done next based on this session's work.

  Steps:
  1. Review what was completed and what was left unfinished
  2. Identify natural follow-up tasks or improvements
  3. Prioritize by impact

  Return ONLY a structured list:
  ## followup-suggester results
  - Task: [what to do] | Priority: [high/medium/low] | Reason: [why]
  (List 3–5 items maximum.)
```

---

## Step 3: Phase 2 — Validation (sequential, after all Phase 1 agents complete)

After all 4 Phase 1 agents return, collect their outputs into a single string:

```
PHASE_1_RESULTS = """
[paste doc-updater output here]

[paste automation-scout output here]

[paste learning-extractor output here]

[paste followup-suggester output here]
"""
```

Then launch ONE more agent. **Before submitting the prompt, replace `{PHASE_1_RESULTS}` with the actual collected output text from all 4 agents** — do not pass the literal placeholder string.

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
prompt: |
  You are a duplicate checker. Review the following 4 analysis results and remove
  or merge any overlapping suggestions.

  {PHASE_1_RESULTS}

  Rules:
  - Full duplicate (same suggestion from 2+ agents): keep the more detailed one, remove the rest
  - Partial overlap (similar intent): merge into a single, better suggestion and note the source
  - Unique items: keep as-is

  Return a single clean consolidated list organized by category:
  📄 Docs to update
  ⚡ Automation ideas
  📚 Learnings
  ➡️  Next actions
```

---

## Step 4: Consolidate + User Selection

Present the duplicate-checked results clearly, then build a dynamic options list based on what the agents actually found:

- Include **"문서 업데이트"** only if doc-updater returned at least one update suggestion
- Include **"자동화 생성"** only if automation-scout returned at least one suggestion
- Include **"학습 기록 저장"** only if learning-extractor returned at least one learning
- Always include **"건너뛰기"**

Then call `AskUserQuestion` with the relevant options and `multiSelect: true`. Example (all options present):

```json
AskUserQuestion({
  "questions": [{
    "question": "세션 정리가 완료됐습니다. 어떤 작업을 실행할까요?",
    "header": "작업 선택",
    "options": [
      {"label": "문서 업데이트", "description": "CLAUDE.md 또는 README에 변경 사항 반영"},
      {"label": "자동화 생성", "description": "반복 패턴을 스킬 또는 스크립트로 만들기"},
      {"label": "학습 기록 저장", "description": "오늘 배운 것을 노트 파일에 저장"},
      {"label": "건너뛰기", "description": "결과 확인만 — 별도 작업 없음"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": true
  }]
})
```

Omit options that aren't applicable (e.g. if doc-updater found nothing, remove "문서 업데이트"). Always keep "건너뛰기".

Execute only the selected actions. Execution instructions for each:

### 문서 업데이트
Use the `Edit` tool to apply the doc-updater's suggestions to the target files.
- Before editing, classify each suggested change as `APPEND`, `REVISE`, or `NEW_SECTION`
- `APPEND`: add new information to the matching section
- `REVISE`: replace outdated or inaccurate text directly so the document reflects the current state cleanly
- `NEW_SECTION`: add a new section only when no existing section is a good fit
- Do NOT rewrite unrelated sections
- Tell the user what was updated and in which file

### 자동화 생성
For each automation suggestion:
1. Determine type: **skill** → use `skill-creator` (required); if not installed, tell the user to install it first — do not create SKILL.md manually; **script** → write to `scripts/<name>.sh` or `scripts/<name>.py`; **hook** → add to `.claude/settings.json` under `hooks`
2. Keep it minimal — implement only what was identified in the session
3. Tell the user what was created and where

### 학습 기록 저장
Append learnings to `~/.claude/learnings.md` (create if it doesn't exist). Format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — [project name]
- [concept/tool/pattern]: [brief explanation]
- [concept/tool/pattern]: [brief explanation]
```

**Size check:** After appending, count the total number of `##` date sections. If there are more than 50 sections, add a note at the top:
```
> ⚠️ This file has grown large. Consider archiving entries older than 90 days to `~/.claude/learnings-archive.md`.
```

Tell the user the file path and what was added.

### 건너뛰기
Do nothing. Confirm to the user that the reflection is complete.

## Quick Reference

**Use when:**
- After a long work session (30+ minutes)
- Before switching to a different project
- After completing a significant feature or milestone

**Skip when:**
- Short Q&A session with no file changes
- Only read code, made no modifications
- Already wrapped up manually
