description: A skill for wrapping up a Codex work session. Summarizes changes made this session, identifies doc update points, automation ideas, learnings, and next actions all at once. Use when the user asks for "$reflect", "reflect", "session reflect", "end session", "세션 정리", "오늘 한 거 정리", or "마무리", or wants a Codex session wrap-up after substantial work.

# Reflect

## Overview

Wrap up a Codex work session by inspecting what actually changed, extracting the highest-signal follow-ups, and then optionally applying selected updates.

- Do not replicate Claude Code `Task`-based subagent orchestration
- Investigate files and diffs directly in the current agent
- Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` only for independent reads
- Default behavior is `report first, edit only when useful`

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect Session State

Collect concrete session evidence first:

- Current workspace structure
- Files created or modified in this session
- Scope of changes from `git status --short` and a relevant diff
- Presence of key documents such as `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, recent specs, or blueprints

Compress this into a short internal `PROJECT_STATE` summary before moving on.

### 2. Produce Four Analyses

Analyze the session in four categories:

1. Docs to update
   - Which docs no longer reflect the implemented behavior
2. Automation ideas
   - Which repeated manual steps could become a skill, script, or hook
3. Learnings
   - What new constraints, techniques, or patterns became clear
4. Next actions
   - The 1-3 most immediate follow-up tasks with the best payoff

Rules:

- Base items only on actual work performed
- Merge duplicates across categories
- Drop low-value or vague items
- Keep outputs concise and actionable

### 3. Present Summary and Ask What to Apply

Report the four analysis buckets first.

If the user explicitly asked to apply updates, do so immediately.

Otherwise ask which action(s) to take next. Prefer `request_user_input` when there are real choices to make.

Possible actions:

- `문서 반영`
- `자동화 아이디어 기록`
- `자동화 스캐폴드 생성`
- `학습 기록 저장`
- `요약만 제공`

Only show actions that are actually available, except `요약만 제공`, which is always valid.

### 4. Apply Follow-up Changes Carefully

Rules for edits:

- If an existing document is relevant, update it in place
- Do not create unrelated files
- Use `apply_patch` for modifications
- Keep changes narrow and directly tied to the session

#### 4a. Docs to update

- Update the smallest relevant existing document
- Before editing, classify each change as `APPEND`, `REVISE`, or `NEW_SECTION`
- `APPEND`: add genuinely new information to the matching section
- `REVISE`: replace outdated or inaccurate statements directly so the document reflects the current truth
- `NEW_SECTION`: add a new section only when no existing section is a good fit
- Leave unrelated sections untouched
- Do not rewrite the whole file unless it is clearly a throwaway draft

#### 4b. Automation ideas

`자동화 아이디어 기록` means documenting accepted ideas, not implementing them.

Rules:

- Prefer updating the smallest relevant existing document that already tracks plans, backlog, specs, or follow-ups
- If no such document exists, include the accepted ideas only in the final response; do not create a new file just to store them
- Record each idea with a concrete trigger, expected input/output, and why it is worth automating

`자동화 스캐폴드 생성` is a separate action and requires explicit user intent.

For each accepted scaffold:

- Skill -> create `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Custom subagent -> create `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` with at least:
  - `name = "<agent-name>"`
  - `description = "<when Codex should use this agent>"`
  - `developer_instructions = """<core behavior rules>"""`
- Script -> create `scripts/<name>.py`
- If `skill-creator` is available and the user wants a real skill scaffold, use it; otherwise create the minimal required structure

Keep automation suggestions and scaffolds narrow. Do not overbuild.

#### 4c. Learnings

Append to `~/.codex/learnings.md` (create it if missing) in this format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD - [project name]
- [concept/tool/pattern]: [one-line explanation]
- [concept/tool/pattern]: [one-line explanation]
```

### 5. Final Output Format

Present results in this order:

1. Session summary
2. Docs to update
3. Automation ideas
4. Learnings
5. Next actions

If any files were modified, include the file paths.

## Notes

- This skill is useful after substantial implementation work, not short Q&A
- Prefer concrete evidence from the repo over memory or vague recap
- Reflection quality depends on selecting only high-signal items, not producing a long checklist
